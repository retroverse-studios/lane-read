# 🟦 One-Page Performance Snapshot

*(PTQ / Regional / Tournament / Training)*

> **Purpose:** Measure execution and decision quality — *not outcome*.

## 🧠 Context (30 seconds, factual only)

* Date / Location:
* Event Type: ☐ PTQ ☐ Regional ☐ Tournament ☐ Training
* Games / Block length:
* Pattern (if known):
* Start time:
* Physical state: ☐ fresh ☐ ok ☐ flat

*(No interpretation here — just anchors memory)*

## 🎯 A. Shot Execution (overall feel, not perfection)

Circle or tick what best reflects the **majority** of shots:

**First Ball**

* Pocket hit rate felt:
  ☐ <50% ☐ ~60% ☐ ~70% ☐ elite
* Typical miss: ☐ inside ☐ outside ☐ long ☐ short
* Ball motion most of the block:
  ☐ early ☐ lazy ☐ cliffed ☐ predictable

**Spare Shooting**

* Single pins: ☐ solid ☐ acceptable ☐ sloppy
* Any avoidable opens? ☐ yes ☐ no

> *Rule:* This is about **patterns**, not exceptions.

## 🧩 B. Decision Quality (core section)

For the block **as a whole**, circle one per line:

* Ball / surface decisions:
  ☐ late ☐ mostly right ☐ proactive
* Lane transition reads:
  ☐ reactive ☐ neutral ☐ ahead
* Adjustments timing:
  ☐ chased ☐ held ☐ anticipated

**Overall decision quality:**
⬜ 1 (behind) ⬜ 2 (adequate) ⬜ 3 (pro-level)

*(This mirrors laneread without needing shot-by-shot detail.)*

## 🧘 C. Mental & Routine Stability

* Pre-shot routine held under pressure:
  ☐ yes ☐ mostly ☐ no
* Recovery after bad shots:
  ☐ 1 frame ☐ 2–3 frames ☐ lingered
* Emotional state during key moments:
  ☐ calm ☐ tight ☐ rushed

---

## 📊 D. Outcome (deliberately brief)

* Average / Result:
* Advanced / Cashed? ☐ yes ☐ no
* Did outcome reflect execution? ☐ yes ☐ partly ☐ no

*(Outcome informs — it does not judge.)*

---

## 📝 E. One-Line Truth (max one sentence)

> “Reads were good, but moves came one game late.”
> “Execution supported higher scores than results.”
> “Spare shooting cost momentum.”

Stop there. No essays.
