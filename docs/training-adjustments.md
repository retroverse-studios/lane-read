# 🔁 Training Adjustment Loop

*(Driven directly by the One-Pager)*

> **Rule:** Pick **one primary adjustment** per cycle (week or block).
> More than one = noise.

---

## 1️⃣ If **Shot Execution** is the weak link

### Signals from one-pager:

* Pocket hit < ~60%
* Miss pattern consistent (inside or outside)
* Ball motion unpredictable

### Training focus (choose one):

* **Target window drill**
  10 shots at arrows ±1 board
  Score doesn’t matter — reset after miss
* **Breakpoint awareness drill**
  Call breakpoint out loud *before* release
* **Speed consistency drill**
  Same line, 10 shots within ±0.2 mph

> Goal: tighten *dispersion*, not chase carry.

---

## 2️⃣ If **Decision Quality** is the weak link (very common in PTQs)

### Signals:

* “Late” or “chased” circled
* Good execution but falling carry
* Video shows correct move — just delayed

### Training focus:

* **Early-move simulation**
  Force a move after 3 frames *even if striking*
* **Two-ball limit games**
  Must solve the lane with only two balls
* **Predict-the-transition drill**
  Write expected move after game 1 → check reality game 2

> Goal: make *moving early* feel normal, not risky.

---

## 3️⃣ If **Mental / Routine Stability** is the weak link

### Signals:

* Routine breaks under pressure
* Recovery takes >2 frames
* Tight starts, better late

### Training focus:

* **Game-1 pressure drill**
  First game counts — no warm-up frames
* **Reset routine practice**
  Deliberate pause + breath after bad shots
* **Consequences practice**
  Miss a spare → stop for 60 seconds

> Goal: shorten the recovery window.

---

## 4️⃣ If **Spare Shooting** is the limiter (often the silent killer)

### Signals:

* “Sloppy” circled
* Avoidable opens noted
* PTQ exits by <20 pins

### Training focus:

* **9-in-a-row single-pin rule**
* **First-ball-only spares**
  One attempt only — like competition
* **Pressure ladder**
  Make 1 → 2 → 3 → reset on miss

> Goal: remove spares as a variable.

---

## 5️⃣ If **Execution was good but results were poor**

### Signals:

* “Outcome didn’t reflect execution”
* Decision quality ≥ 2
* Mental stability solid

### Training focus:

* **Nothing major. Maintain.**
* Light sessions
* Video review only

> This is where **restraint** matters most.

# 🧭 How this fits the bigger picture

After each PTQ / Regional / Tournament:

1. Complete the one-pager
2. Circle the *weakest section*
3. Choose **one** training response for the week
4. Re-evaluate next block

This avoids:

* overreacting to bad results
* random training
* emotional “fix everything” weeks

## One quiet psychological benefit

This system shifts the internal question from:

> “Am I good enough?”

to:

> “What’s the next controllable lever?”
