# 1️⃣ Adjusted Training System for Limited Perth Lane Access

Constraints you mentioned:

* Few alleys open, limited fresh oil
* Glow / school hours may limit access
* Sessions often 2 hours max
* Travel time consumes energy

### ✅ Core Principles

1. **Quality over quantity:** 2–3 focused sessions per week beats 4–5 “general” sessions.
2. **Simulation drills:** Use short blocks (3–6 games max) to mimic PTQ conditions.
3. **Decision logging + review:** Always use the laneread sheet, even if lanes aren’t perfect.
4. **Off-lane prep:** Physical, mental, and visualization work counts as “practice” when lanes aren’t available.

### 🔁 Weekly Perth Session Example

| Day | Focus                      | Duration   | Drill Notes                                                          |
| --- | -------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mon | Shot quality / breakpoints | 90–120 min | 10–15 targeted first-ball frames at varying arrows; record decisions |
| Wed | Decision / PTQ sim         | 90 min     | 3 games block; focus on early moves and spares; use laneread sheet   |
| Fri | Mental / spare / “chaos”   | 60–90 min  | Single-pin drills or unfamiliar lane surface if available            |

> Optional: Home visualization or band work on Tues/Thu if lanes aren’t accessible.

# ⚡ Practical Notes

1. **Travel + alley access:** Factor transit into session energy budget; shorter, sharper sessions > long, wasted time.
2. **Limited oil / alley variety:** Treat these conditions as *bonus chaos practice*; helps PTQs where oil patterns differ.
3. **Data + decisions > pinfall:** Especially when conditions are imperfect. One-pager + video is what matters, not average.
4. **Focus lever:** Pick **1 major adjustment per block**, don’t try to fix everything.
