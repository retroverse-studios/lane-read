# BOWLING DECISION TREE CHEAT SHEET

## IF I SEE → THEN TRY

| What I See | Adjustment Options |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Ball right of target (D+)** | Move feet RIGHT (same boards as miss) OR target LEFT |
| **Ball left of target (D-)** | Move feet LEFT (same boards as miss) OR target RIGHT |
| **Hook too EARLY (H+)** | 1) Loft more  2) More speed  3) Move left (find oil)  4) Softer hand |
| **Hook too LATE (H-)** | 1) Less loft  2) Less speed  3) Move right (find friction)  4) Firmer hand |
| **Ball too FAST (S+)** | Slow tempo, softer push, relax hand |
| **Ball too SLOW (S-)** | Quicker tempo, longer push, stay behind ball |
| **Early + Left miss** | Move left, add loft, possibly loft gutter cap |
| **Late + Right miss** | Move right, reduce loft, consider ball change to stronger |
| **Weak pin carry (hits but no strike)** | More entry angle: move in, play more hook OR axis adjustment |
| **Over/under reaction** | Ball change or surface adjustment |

## RELEASE ADJUSTMENTS

| Adjustment | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| **Axis 0° (straight up)** | End-over-end roll, earliest hook, most hook potential, reads mids early |
| **Axis 45° (behind)** | Balanced roll, standard release, predictable arc |
| **Axis 90° (around/spinner)** | Skids longer, delays read, less total hook, good for dry/short patterns |
| **Pinky curl (increase)** | Adds axis rotation, increases side roll, more backend reaction |
| **Pinky curl (decrease)** | Cleaner release, more predictable, less backend snap |
| **Soft hand** | Later release, more loft, ball reads later, less rev |
| **Hard/firm hand** | Earlier release, cleaner, ball reads earlier, more rev |

## BALL SELECTION

| Ball/Setup | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| **Pearl cover** | Skids through heads, sharp backend, best on medium-dry or when heads are fried |
| **Solid cover** | Earlier read, smoother arc, best on fresh oil or heavy volume |
| **Hybrid cover** | Balanced: some length with continuous motion |
| **Urethane** | Minimal skid, very early read, controls over/under, spare ball on sport shots |
| **Pin UP** | Later roll, more length, more backend, higher flare potential |
| **Pin DOWN** | Earlier roll, smoother arc, more predictable, lower flare |
| **Higher surface (500-1000)** | More friction, earlier hook, smoother shape |
| **Lower surface (2000-4000+)** | More length, skids more, sharper backend |

## ADJUSTMENT HIERARCHY (try in order)

| Priority | Adjustment Type | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| **1. LINE FIRST** | Feet/target moves | Smallest risk, easiest to execute |
| **2. LOFT/SPEED** | Physical adjustments | Moderate risk, changes ball reaction |
| **3. RELEASE** | Axis/hand changes | Higher risk, requires feel adjustment |
| **4. BALL CHANGE** | Last resort | Time consuming, but sometimes necessary |
