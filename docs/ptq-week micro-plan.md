# 2️⃣ PTQ-Week Micro-Plan (Travel-Aware)

Assumptions:

* He flies ~17 days from now
* Limited recovery from jet lag
* Alley availability may be inconsistent

### 🛫 Pre-Travel (Week -1 to Flight)

* **1–2 Perth sessions max** (quality only)
* Mental prep: visualize PTQ patterns, simulate first-game nerves
* Light gym / mobility; avoid heavy fatigue

### ✈️ Arrival + Adjustment (Day 1–3 US)

* Adjust to time zone / sleep
* Light lane sessions (30–60 min), focusing on feel
* Record decisions only — no heavy PTQ simulation
* Skip high-stakes practice — energy preservation

### 🏁 Pre-PTQ Tuning (Day 4–7 US)

* **PTQ simulation sessions**: 3–4 short blocks, 3 games each
* Laneread + one-pager after each block
* Focus on:

  * First-ball consistency
  * Early moves / lane transitions
  * Spare conversions under pressure
* Video optional if alley rules allow

### 🥇 PTQ Competition Days

* Warm-up: light 15–20 min block only
* Pre-block routine + focus on **process metrics only** (not score)
* Complete one-pager after each block
* Post-day review: identify **1 controllable adjustment** for next day

### 📊 Post-PTQ / Recovery

* 10–15 min reflection: what went well, what was controllable
* Maintain **execution over results** mindset
* Optional light lane session or mental rehearsal

# ⚡ Practical Notes

1. **Uber + alley access:** Factor transit into session energy budget; shorter, sharper sessions > long, wasted time.
2. **Limited oil / alley variety:** Treat these conditions as *bonus chaos practice*; helps PTQs where oil patterns differ.
3. **Data + decisions > pinfall:** Especially when conditions are imperfect. One-pager + video is what matters, not average.
4. **Focus lever:** Pick **1 major adjustment per block**, don’t try to fix everything.
