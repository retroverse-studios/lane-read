Mobile-first bowling shot tracker for recording lane reads and comparing decisions against video review.

## What is this?

A simple tool to help competitive bowlers improve their lane reading skills by tracking:

- **What you saw** - Direction, hook timing, speed
- **What you decided** - Feet, target, loft, release adjustments
- **What actually happened** - Video comparison (V = match, X = misread)

The goal: find patterns in your misreads and develop better decision-making on the lanes.

## Usage

1. Open [laneread.com](https://laneread.com) on your phone
2. Tap **+ New** to start a game
3. Fill in equipment, then expand each shot to record observations and decisions
4. After the game, review video and mark V (video confirms) or X (you misread)
5. Tap 🖨️ to save as PDF for your records

All data saves to your browser's local storage - no account needed.

## Features

- 💾 Auto-saves to localStorage
